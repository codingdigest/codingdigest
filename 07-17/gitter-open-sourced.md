Gitter, the popular chat application developed for open source projects, has been open sourced itself. Gitter has seen its user base steadily grow and currently powers the community for a large number of projects. Anyone is now able to build on top of the source code. GitLab purchased Gitter in March of 2017 with the promise of open sourcing shortly after.
