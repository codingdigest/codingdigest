npx is now packaged by default with npm. Following the 5.2.0 release, developers can now take advantage of the tool to help round out the package management experience. The same way npm makes it super easy to install and manage dependencies, npx is meant to make it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry as well. It greatly simplifies a number of things that, until now, required a bit of ceremony to do with plain npm.
