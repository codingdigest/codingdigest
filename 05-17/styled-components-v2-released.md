Building user interfaces for large scale web applications was never the same
after combining HTML and JavaScript to create components. CSS has been the
missing area that was left behind during the frontend end evolution, and
Style Components has attempted to modernize this essential piece of the puzzle.
The updates for version 2 include cutting the bundle size in half,
adding `.attrs` to help integrate exisiting CSS codebases, helper functions
to share styles between components, and a Babel plugin.
