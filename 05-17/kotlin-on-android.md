Google has announced that Kotlin, the modern programming language developed by JetBrains that runs on the JVM, will now receive first-class support in [Android Studio 3](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html). This is a huge win for the Android community and will play a significant role in the future of Android development. Kotlin aims to have a more friendly syntax for developers in order to improve production and code readability. Likewise, the language includes null safety, functional programming support, and imposes no runtime overhead.
