Facebook has released the major version of React before the highly anticipated
version 16. In favor of a smaller code base, the react team has moved PropTypes
and createClass to separate packages. In addition, they've included a codemod
to assist with the migration to the new patterns. The React team is also
discontinuing support for React Addons, and the Reat Test Utils are moving from
React to React DOM.
