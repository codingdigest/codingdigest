In a huge win for the future of web development, the initial design for the
WebAssembly API (in JavaScript) and binary format have been completed. The
WebAssembly team represents all the major browsers, including Chrome, Edge,
Firefox, and Webkit. The outcome of WebAssembly is to create a binary format
for browsers which will ultimately improve performance and decrease bundle size.
The teams are now hard at work integrating the WebAssembly into browsers and
updating the developer tools to make move the future of the web forward. For
the engineers that love being no the cutting edge, you can begin experimenting
with WebAssembly by [compiling](http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) on your own machine.
