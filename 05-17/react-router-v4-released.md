The router for React finally became React Router. It follows the paradigms of
React and is the first version of the router endorsed by the React core team.
It's simplified and is now now "just components", making it declarative and allowing
developers to use the React lifecycle instead of route hooks.For a further
explanation of the change, watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vur2dAFZ4GE)
by the founders of React explaining their motivation for the API change.
