You can now check the trends on Stack Overflow with their new [Trends tool](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends).
The tool can be used to see the rise and fall of languages and frameworks. 
For example, Python seems to be getting a lot of attention lately while PHP is experiencing a decline. 
React, Angular, and Vue are all doing very well while other frameworks appear to be in the later stage of their life cycles.
