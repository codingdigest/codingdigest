React 16 is the most highly anticipated release in a long time. As of late-May,
the server-side rendering tests are passing which puts the release date in sight.
The reason for the excitement over 16 is that it includes
[Fiber](http://isfiberreadyyet.com/) which is a reimplementation of the core
algorithm for React. The headline feature of for this improvement is incremental
rendering which will chunk rendering process. Luckily the API will not change,
so all React users can benefit from the update without needing code changes
